PATTERN Matching in text files


grep/egrep - (extended) global regular expression print

	egrep pattern file
	- print every line in file that contains pattern
	- eg: print everyline in index.html that contains cs246

How many lines in index.html that contains CS246 or cs246?

	egrep "cs246|CS246" index.html
OR	egrep "(cs|CS)246" index.html

Available patters: called regular expressions (different from globbing patterns)

	"(c|C)(s|S)246" - also matches cS246, Cs246
	== "[cC][sS]246"

[...] - any one character between [ and ]
[^..] - any one character except  ...

Something

? = 0 or 1 of preceding expression (in this case: 0 or 1 space)
* = 0 or more of preceding

(cs)*246 => 246, cs246, cscs246, cscscs246, ...

.* = anything
	eg: egrep "cs.*246" index.html
	- lines containing cs...(anything)...246

^,$ - beginning/end of the line

	"^cs246" - lines that start with cs246
	"^cs246$" - lines that equal to cs246

+ = 1 or more occurances
.+ = non-empty

	eg: lines of even length
	- ^(..)*$

	eg: files in the current dir whose names contain exactly one 'a'
	- ls | egrep  "^[^a]*a[^a]$"

	ex: All words in the global dictionary that start with e and has 5 characters.
	- egrep "^e[.]???" /usr/share/dict/words
